### Project Overview

 # Handling Program Flow in Python

IPL Dataset Analysis

Problem Statement

We want to know as to what happens during an IPL match which raises several questions in our mind with our limited knowledge about the game called cricket on which it is based. This analysis is done to know as which factors led one of the team to win and how does it matter.

About the Dataset :
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional T20 cricket league in India contested during April-May of every year by teams representing Indian cities. It is the most-attended cricket league in the world and ranks sixth among all the sports leagues. It has teams with players from around the world and is very competitive and entertaining with a lot of close matches between teams.


### Learnings from the project

Using for loops

Slicing and dicing of json data

Creating and running functions



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 First created a variable for deliveries and sliced and diced the data using dictionary key pairs and used a for loop to run the total deliveries faced by a batsman.
 
Created a variable for man of the match and sliced and diced the data using dictionary key pairs and and later list slicing and used a for loop to run the loop over total matches played and runs scored by man of the match.

Created a variable for sixes and sliced and diced the data using dictionary key pairs and and later list slicing and used a for loop to run the loop over sixes played and appended to an empty list. Created a function which takes in a list and counts the frequency of player hit six to print the maximum sixes.

In similar way created variables for batsman who got out only in second  innings as well as to calcuate the scores of wides, legbyes, etc.
